# Explain:

First, we have decleared a variable named a, which will take user input. Look carefully, we have made the input to int. We wrote,

> a = int(input("Input Your Number Here."))

Then we have decleared a num variable which will count the numbers from 1. We have set the value 1 because if we set the value 0, the counter will start from 0. You can assign the value as 0. But before starting the loop, you have to increase the value.

> num = 1

Then we have coded a while loop. As the condition of the while loop we have said, while num is less than a or one, python have to print num. And then, we have increased the value. So, Python will check the condition and then run the code. When he/she can prove the condition to be false, he/she will stop the loop.

> while num < a:

>   print (num)
  
>   num = num + 1
  
Then, we said Python, "Hey! you have to print a now."

> print(a)

Simple. Now, the overwall code is-

> a = int(input("Input Your Number Here."))

> num = 1

> while num < a:

>   print (num)
  
>   num = num + 1

> print(a)

Now, read this again and again untill you understand it.
